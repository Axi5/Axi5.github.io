        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a 3D designer that became interested in this career path because of my passion for games and real time technologies. My time in this career has made me very competent at creating graphics with hardware and time constraints and then designing
            and programming solutions for them. My aim is to take the skills I currently have and to create games with people who also share my passion.</p>

    <div class="experience">
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>4-5 Years at RT Software broadcast graphics</h3>
        <p>My time with this company has been very valuable and I have learnt a lot in deep detail about technologies in real time graphics, working in a team and to some degree some business practises. My role in this company is as a 3D designer, where
            we implement television graphics for customers, including the BBC, Sky and many more. Some of my common tasks are to create 3D real time graphics using various software packages such as Photoshop, Maya, Max, Blender and more, while scripting
            logic in Ruby and writing shaders in CgFX.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>2011-2015 - BA Hons Game Art | University of South Wales</h3>
        <p>I studied for 4 years at University of South Wales, but the first two were actually studing Film and Television. It was clear after 2 years that my true passion lied in creating video game art so I was transferred into the 2nd year Game Art course
            where I learnt a lot more and studied with a fantastic group of people.</p>

        <h2>Skills &amp; Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Digital Content Creation(DCC) Tools</h3>
        <p>I'm proficient in most DCC packages including Photoshop, Substance and most industry standard 3D tools. Recently, my primary tool has been Blender, I enjoy discussing and contributing to the future of the software. 3D Software packages I am comfortable
            in are:</p>
        <p>3ds Max | Blender | Houdini | Maya | Modo | Zbrush</p>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I enjoy creating games, I have taken part in a few game jams including one as part of a group. My primary engine of choice is Unreal Engine, which I have been using since it has been available as UDK. I have recently been writing gameplay code
            in C++ and have been enjoying it a lot. Some of the languages I am comfortable in are:</p>
        <p>C# | C++ | CgFX | Python | Ruby | Vex</p>
        <h3>Other Skills &amp; Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Before I was creating games, I was creating websites and ran a small 3D tutorial website for Cinema4D users. This also makes me familiar with HTML, PHP, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        <p>I enjoy visiting Siggraph London events where I can meet and enjoy a beer with VFX artists, tools and graphics developers. Keeping up with industry techniques and development satisfies my curiosity and inspires me to create more.</p>
